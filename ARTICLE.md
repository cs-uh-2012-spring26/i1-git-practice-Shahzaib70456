### Summary & Reflection

I found this page from Michigan Technological University’s College of Computing very interesting because it provides a clear and practical overview of what software engineering really involves. It explains that **software engineering is not just programming**, but an engineering discipline that encompasses the **design, development, testing, and maintenance** of software systems.

What stood out to me most is how the article emphasizes the **breadth of the field**: software engineers work across industries and technologies that touch nearly every part of modern life. It also discusses career opportunities, common roles, and even salary expectations, showing why software engineering is both **challenging and rewarding** as a profession.

Overall, this page helped me better understand how software engineering blends technical skills with engineering principles to solve real-world problems, an outlook that I think is valuable for anyone considering a career in computing.
